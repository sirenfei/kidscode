					<h3>1. Coding Develops Problem-Solving Skills</h3>
					<p>Learning to code helps kids develop critical thinking skills as well as the ability to solve problems. When children are working on solving a programming problem, trying to get the computer to do something, they are learning to look past the bigger picture and breakdown the problem into smaller, manageable tasks. They are able to make logical connections. Those skills aren’t needed just to make your computer do something, they are useful in everyday life as well.</p>
					<p>And once kids gain those skills, they can analyze any situation and find an appropriate solution. It’s a skill that’s welcome no matter which career they choose and it builds their confidence as they become aware that they are capable of finding solutions and achieving their goals.</p>
					<h3>2. Coding Encourages Creativity</h3>
					<p>In programming, as in life, there is more than one way to solve a problem. Once your child learns the basic concepts, they will realize they are limited only by their imaginations. They can find their own solutions and they can examine someone else’s code and add their own tweaks to it to make it better. In fact, many programs we use today were created as improvements and variations upon older versions.</p>
					<p>Because of this, coding can be a highly engaging and fun activity. Many platforms designed for teaching code to kids start them off by playing games where very basic commands are introduced. Additional challenges are then added by making more complex commands and combining them to expand functionality. When kids are done, they will have a completed version of their own game or app.</p>
					<h3>3. Younger Kids Pick Up New Skills Faster </h3>
					<p>Kids have an easier time learning skills because their minds are like sponges. They absorb new information almost effortlessly. Learning to code is like learning another language, and it has been proven that babies and toddlers have an easier time mastering another language. There’s no better time than the present to introduce coding.</p>
					<h3>4. Coding is Widely Used</h3>
					<p>Computer science is present in our everyday lives. We rely on software development more than ever, and it doesn’t show signs of stopping. Smartwatches, TVs, heart implants, cars: they are all becoming a part of the Internet of Things which only proves how big a part computer science plays in our lives. When we teach our children to code, they will be able to understand the world around them and gain skills that are highly sought on the job market.</p>
					<h3>5. Coding Is Fun</h3>
					<p>Putting aside the practical applications of coding, consider the fact that creating a game, a simple app, or an animation of their own, can be tremendously fun for kids. Especially if you do away with the traditional classroom setting and introduce coding in the form of a game.</p>
